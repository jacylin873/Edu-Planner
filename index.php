        <p>The motto of the State University of New York is “To Learn. To Search. To Serve.” An education at SUNY New Paltz develops knowledge and helps our students recognize that life is complex and worthy of endless curiosity. Our students come away from their classrooms, residence halls, and service activities with an understanding of how the thoughtful application of knowledge and collaborative learning promote active engagement in communities (from local to global), critical reflection, and personal responsibility.</p>

        <h2 id="studentgoals">Student goals</h2>

        <p>Acquire a foundation of knowledge: Enabling you to engage with different aspects of our world. You will gain exposure to the ways in which artists, humanists, mathematicians, and natural and social scientists address questions about the world and ourselves. You will explore and learn to apply quantitative reasoning, qualitative interpretation, and creative activity as means of addressing those questions.</p>
        <p>Explore questions of identity and community: Reflecting on who you are and your commonality and difference with respect to others. Through interacting with our diverse student body, studying or visiting regions of the world, exploring the activities and communities within and surrounding the university, and learning about diversity within the US and elsewhere, you will become an informed global citizen.</p>
        <p>Learn how to organize, synthesize, and apply information: Making and critiquing arguments; and expressing yourself clearly in multiple modes. These analytical, critical, and communicative skills will serve you at the university and beyond.</p>
        <p>Specialize in at least one disciplinary area of knowledge: Succeeding in that field, applying your expertise in other arenas, and/or going on to advanced study prepared to engage confidently with other practitioners or scholars.</p>
